He obtained his Ph.D. in Biology at the Philipps-Universität Marburg in Germany, at the LOEWE Center for Synthetic Microbiology under Prof Torsten Waldminghaus. His research focused on the construction of synthetic secondary chromosomes to analyse chromosome maintenance systems in Escherichia coli. [br]His current research projects are straightened to the design, construction and characterization of neochromosomes in baker´s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In his opinion there are many open questions in the field of chromosome research and recent progress in Synthetic Biology can provide answers through construction of synthetic chromosomes.[br]In his free time, Daniel enjoys outdoor sports (climbing, mountaineering and running), travelling and good food.

She graduated with a first class MSc degree in Microbial and Biochemical Pharmacy from China Pharmaceutical University. She then moved to Belgium for her PhD studying and obtained her PhD in Biology from KULeuven supervised by Professor Johan Thevelein and Dr. Maria Foulquié. Her research focused on the development of superior industrial yeast strains that can convert pentose and hexose (xylose) sugars to bioethanol and improvement of inhibitors (salt, furfural, HMF, acids, etc.) tolerance of yeast strains. Following graduation, she worked as a Knowledge Exchange Associate at the University of Strathclyde and a Lab facility manager at IBioIC.[br]Her current research is focused on the yeast chromosomal rDNA repeats combined with the synthetic chromosomes, exploring the influence of the rDNA copy number and instability in the important functions of the nucleolus and lifespan.",

Reem obtained her PhD in Biotechnology from the University of Manchester under the supervision of Prof. Mark Ashe and Prof. Chris Grant. She constructed various mutants of S. cerevisiae strains to produce butanol by introducing the ABE pathway into yeast, applying metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies to enhance butanol production. Reem started working as a Post-doc prior to finishing her PhD in Mark Ashe lab. Reem has obtained her MSc in Biotechnology and her Bachelor degree in Agricultural Engineering and Food Science from the University of Damascus. Reem has gained extensive experience in teaching as she worked as assistant lecturer at the University of Damascus and the University of Tishreen.[br]Reem currently is working on multiple projects. First, she is focusing on engineering and biosynthesizing natural product-like drugs such as Pentalenolactone, which is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. She assembles biosynthesis pathways using YeastFab technology. Second, her research interests are combining Engineering and Molecular Biology for exploring potential applications of Synthetic Biology. Reem is also using SCRaMBLE system to generate high-fitness yeast cells bearing the synthetic chromosomes  and under specific conditions and this will allow her to create genome diversity with the ability to produce new biological functions. In her free time, she enjoys working as a volunteer and contributes to fund raising for many UK registered charities including Syria relief. Reem loves reading, painting, cooking, travelling and exploring life. ",

His work involves using CRISPR and adeno-associated virus (AAV) to develop tools for rewriting human genomes. These will allow analysis of the functionalities of genetic sequences at a previously unattained resolution. This project is in collaboration with the Chew Lab (Genome Institute of Singapore). Outside of the lab, Josh enjoys travel, SCUBA diving and climbing.",

He then joined in 2017 the research team lead by Dr. Jean-Paul di Rago, France, to work on the nuclear relocation of mitochondrial genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.[br]His current research aims at implementing a fully synthetic, size-reduced and functional mitochondrial genome in S. cerevisiae by removing the presumably non-essential inter- and intragenic sequences, representing more than 80% of the mitochondrial genome size. Kewin truly believes that mitochondria play a central role in eukaryotic cell’s adaptive capabilities and evolution.[br]In his spare time, Kewin enjoys learning about psychology, playing guitar and cooking.",
