Reem started working as a Post-doc prior to finishing her PhD in Mark Ashe lab. Reem has obtained her MSc in Biotechnology and her Bachelor degree in Agricultural Engineering and Food Science from the University of Damascus. Reem has gained extensive experience in teaching as she worked as assistant lecturer at the University of Damascus and the University of Tishreen.[br]Reem currently is working on multiple projects. First, she is focusing on engineering and biosynthesizing natural product-like drugs such as Pentalenolactone, which is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. She assembles biosynthesis pathways using YeastFab technology. Second, her research interests are combining Engineering and Molecular Biology for exploring potential applications of Synthetic Biology. Reem is also using SCRaMBLE system to generate high-fitness yeast cells bearing the synthetic chromosomes  and under specific conditions and this will allow her to create genome diversity with the ability to produce new biological functions. In her free time, she enjoys working as a volunteer and contributes to fund raising for many UK registered charities including Syria relief.
